<li>New Delhi is the national capital of India.</li>
<li> In December 1911 King George V of Britain decreed that the capital of British India would 
be moved from Calcutta (which is today called Kolkata) to Delhi.</li>
<li> Construction began in 1912 at a site about 3 miles (5 km), south of the Delhi city centre, 
and the new capital was formally dedicated in 1931.</li>
<li> New Delhi is best known as the location of India’s national government.</li>
<li> New Delhi has great historical significance as it was home to powerful people, such as the 
Pāṇḍavas and the Mughals.</li>
<li> The city has many historical monuments and tourist attractions as well as lively 
marketplaces and great food, such as chaat.</li>
<li> New Delhi is among the world’s most polluted cities.</li><li> Contributing to the smog 
are traffic congestion, heavy industry, and the lack of cleansing winds in the area.</li>
<li> Although antipollution measures undertaken since the 1980s have improved the city’s air 
quality considerably, pollution continues to be a deadly problem. </li>
